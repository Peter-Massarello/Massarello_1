The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the enviorment in hoare
while practicing system calls. You will also demonstrate your proficiency in the use of
'perror' and 'getopt' in this submission. This excercise 2.12 is in your text by Robbins.

This project was very rough to say the least. While I do have experience in C++, my experience
in C is nothing compared to that. I feel like I had to learn a lot of this own my own, or
through help of friends. I tried looking at Microsoft Teams but much of what was on there
confused me as well. While I have used getopt before in my 2750 class, all the parts
that came with getopt like optind, optarg, etc I have never used before. Same with
malloc, realloc, etc.

I also had trouble fully understanding the projects in its enitirety. There were many times 
where I was confused on the prompt and started writing a program that, while it worked, was
incorrect for the project. You can see this from my massive adds and deletes in my git
history.

After going into an SI session though I was able to understand this project MUCH more. My
main issue was having a combined confusion of what I need to do and how I would do it. But 
once I knew what I had to do, learning how to do it came much easier. It took me nearly four
days to get the -i part working and by the time I did, it was actually an incorrect way
of implimenting it. But after that SI session, I was able to finish the project the next day.

I hope for next assignments we get more practice going into them so the stress of trying
to finish this won't be as high.
