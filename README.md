The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the enviorment in hoare
while practicing system calls. You will also demonstrate your proficiency in the use of
'perror' and 'getopt' in this submission. This excercise 2.12 is in your text by Robbins.

This project was very rough to say the least. While I do have experience in C++, my experience
in C is nothing compared to that. I feel like I had to learn a lot of this own my own, or
through help of friends. I tried looking at Microsoft Teams but much of what was on there
confused me as well. While I have used getopt before in my 2750 class, all the parts
that came with getopt like optind, optarg, etc I have never used before. Same with
malloc, realloc, etc. 

I hope for next assignments we get more practice going into them so the stress of trying
to finish this won't be as high.
